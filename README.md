# 👋 Hi, I'm Solomon  
### LUA Developer (FiveM) • PHP Developer • Full-Stack Learner • WordPress Specialist

I am a self-taught developer with strong experience in **FiveM (LUA) scripting**, **WordPress performance optimization**, **PHP Frameworks (or basic)**, and **Python automation**.  
Throughout the years, I have built **full FiveM server systems**, **anti-cheat modules**, **admin web panels**, **custom WordPress setups**, and various automation tools.

My style of development is based on:  
**clean structure, high performance, security, stability, and unbreakable logic**.

### 🔹 **FiveM / LUA Development**

I have developed multiple systems for FiveM servers — from gameplay logic to security and admin tooling:

- **Complete custom FiveM servers** (freelancing projects)  
- **Anti-Cheat system**  
  - Internal & external cheat detection  
  - Behavior & pattern monitoring  
  - Injection detection concepts  
- **Admin WebPanels (connected to MySQL database)**  
  - Manage players, bans, vehicles, jobs  
  - Web → DB → Server communication  
  - Bootstrap / Laravel based  
- **Game Related Systems - (JS, CSS, HTML, LUA, Typescript)**
- **Custom server-side tools & optimizations**

FiveM scripting is my strongest point — I build everything with performance and security in mind.
