## 📌 Overview

This is one of my first full-stack projects: a **User Control Panel (UCP)** for a **GTA: San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP)** server, built in **April 2020** using **Laravel 6/7**.

At the time, Laravel 7 had just launched (March 2020), and Laravel 6 (LTS) was still widely used — this project likely used one of the two. It served as a functional, self-hosted dashboard where players could:
- View & manage their in-game account (stats, inventory, progress)
- Submit & track support tickets
- Browse server rules, updates, and staff lists
- (Optional integrations) Link Discord, view live player count, etc.

Designed for **roleplay-focused servers**, the UCP prioritized clean UI, responsiveness, and ease of extension — no bloated CMS, no unnecessary plugins.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 7.3, Laravel 6/7
- **Frontend**: Blade templating, Bootstrap 4, vanilla JS/jQuery  
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Auth**: Laravel’s built-in auth (customized for SA:MP MySQL database)  
- **Hosting**: Shared/VPS (cPanel environment), tested on Apache  
> 🔧 originally deployed on XAMPP-style setups.

## ⚠️ Note

This is **archival code** — not production-ready by 2025 standards (no Laravel 10+, no API-first design, limited security hardening).  
But as a historical artifact or educational base? Still solid.
